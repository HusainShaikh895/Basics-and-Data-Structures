Byte sized programmes in python3 (mostly)

**- TESTING DECISION TREE CLASSIFIER FOR AND / OR LOGIC - andor.py**

Classifying Lists of two numbers trained on AND / OR logic 

**- BINARY SEARCH - binary.py :**

 To search for an element using Divide and Conquer
Time Complexity - O(logn)

**- BUBBLE SORT - bubble.py**

Bubble sort  - to sort a given list of numbers
Time Complexity - O(n^2)

**- DATE TO DAY - date2day.py**

Calculates Day from a given date in 2019

**- DOUBLE ENDED QUEUE - dqueue.py**

Double Ended Queue using ```list[]```

**- INSERTION SORT - insertion.py**

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.

**-LEANING TOWER OF LIRE - leaning.py**


Given the length of each uniform stable shape and an end goal to reach in metres, calculate number of blocks required to reach the target

```
   ___
     ___
       ___
       
```
they are a structure like above


The upper one can go half its length without falling and others follow arithmetic sequence
```1/(2*n)```

Inspired by this concept
