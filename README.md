# Basics-and-Data-Structures
Byte sized programmes in python3 (mostly)

**- TESTING DECISION TREE CLASSIFIER FOR AND / OR LOGIC - andor.py**

Classifying Lists of two numbers trained on AND / OR logic 

**- BINARY SEARCH - binary.py :**

 To search for an element using Divide and Conquer
Time Complexity - O(logn)

**- BUBBLE SORT - bubble.py**

Bubble sort  - to sort a given list of numbers
Time Complexity - O(n^2)

**- DATE TO DAY - date2day.py**

Calculates Day from a given date in 2019

**- DOUBLE ENDED QUEUE - dqueue.py**

Double Ended Queue using ```list[]```

**- INSERTION SORT - insertion.py**

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.

**-LEANING TOWER OF LIRE - leaning.py**


Given the length of each uniform stable shape and an end goal to reach in metres, calculate number of blocks required to reach the target

```
   ___
     ___
       ___
       
```
they are a structure like above


The upper one can go half its length without falling and others follow arithmetic sequence
```1/(2*n)```

Inspired by this concept

**- LINKED LIST - linkedlist.py**

Simple Linked list without using User defined class

**- CLASSIFIER FOR LOGIC GATES - logic_gates_classifier.py**

This program predicts output of logic gates. Type of logic gate is passed as feature.
Currently supports :
AND, OR and XOR gate.

**- MATRIX ROTATION - 90 DEGREES CLOCKWISE - matrix.py**
```

1 2 3     
4 5 6  	
7 8 9  

```
rotate 90 degrees

```
7 4 1
8 5 2
9 6 3

```
**- Morse Convertor - morse.py**

Convert Morse to Text and Vice-Versa.(Alphanumeric only)



**- FIND DIVISORS - ndivisors.py**

Find Total number of divisors of all the numbers between 0 - given number

**- PRIMALITY TEST - primality.py**

Checks if a number is prime or not.

**- CIRCULAR NUMBER ROTATION - rotate.c**

Rotates a given number by a specified number. 

**- SIMPLE QUEUE DATA STRUCTURE - Queue.py**

Queue Data structure using FIFO principle

**- SELECTION SORT - selection.py**

In computer science, selection sort is a sorting algorithm, specifically an in-place comparison sort. It has O time complexity, making it inefficient on large lists, and generally performs worse than the similar insertion sort. -  [Wikipedia](Selection sort - Wikipedia
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort)
Worst complexity: `n^2`
Average complexity: `n^2`
Best complexity: `n^2`
Space complexity: `1`
Method: `Selection`
Stable: `No`
Class: `Comparison sort`

**- SIEVE OF ERATOSTHENES - soe.py**


Sieve of Eratosthenes: algorithm steps for primes below 121 (including optimization of starting from prime's square).
In mathematics, the sieve of Eratosthenes is a simple, ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit.

**- SCISSOR PAPER ROCK GAME - TEXT BASED - spr.java**

Text Based Scissor paper Rock game in Java.

**- STACK DATA STRCUTURE - Stack.py**

Stack is an ordered list of similar data type. Stack is a LIFO(Last in First out) structure or we can say FILO(First in Last out). push() function is used to insert new elements into the Stack and pop() function is used to remove an element from the stack.
